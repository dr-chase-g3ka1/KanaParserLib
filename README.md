A Java library for kana parsing.

### What is this repository for? ###

This library enables your app to parse Hiragana or Katakana strings to romaji.
It can also parse from romaji to Hiragana or Katakana.
Version: 1.0.0-BETA

### How do I get set up? ###

This is a maven project so you will need maven. The project is set up to create a JAR file with dependencies.
Since it is written in Java you will need JDK too. I'm not sure about the min SDK level, it's probably 1.5 .
Currently there is no maven repo for this library.

To build: 
`mvn package`

To create docs and test reports:
`mvn site`

Javadoc will be available soon here:
